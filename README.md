**Lawson** is a tool for lawyers to help them understand judgements faster and more accurately while also being able to query the judgements themselves.

**Lawson** uses machine learning to extract the most important information from a judgement and present it in a clear and concise way. This allows lawyers to quickly get to the heart of a case and make more informed decisions.
